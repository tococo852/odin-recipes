    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly,
            5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>        
        </li>
    </ol>
