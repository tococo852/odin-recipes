    <h1>Campbell's Tuna Noodle Casserole</h1>
    <img src="../images/tunanoodle.webp">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tuna, noodles, pickles, and cheese recipe came from my grandmother, who used peas instead of pickles in her version. My mother changed the recipe, and I have altered it even more. The flavors of these ingredients blend together in what is reminiscent of a cold macaroni or potato salad. It will be your family's new favorite!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 ounces Colby-Jack cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>2 dill pickles, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) can albacore tuna in water, drained and flaked        </li>
        <li>½ cup light mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Rinse under cold running water, then drain well and pat lightly with paper towels.        </p></li>
        <li><p>Combine macaroni, Colby-Jack cheese, pickles, tuna, mayonnaise, and mustard in a large bowl. Season with pickle juice, salt, and black pepper.        </p></li>
        <li><p>Cover bowl; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
